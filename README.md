# Support-Vector-Machine-Linear-Separation
Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classification with Bilevel Cross-Validation in Octave

This project implements a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier using Octave to separate two classes of points from a given dataset. The implementation strictly follows the given project requirements, including dual optimization, primal recovery, and cross-validation for model selection and evaluation.

Key Features
- Dataset: Loads a .mat dataset containing feature matrix X and labels y.

- Preprocessing:
  - Standardizes features to zero mean and unit variance.
  - Ensures labels are mapped to +1 and -1.
